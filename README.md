# ðŸ‘¾ playdate-arcade-fonts

*This project is work-in-progress*

This project is meant as a love letter to the typography of arcade classics. It contains a growing collection of bitmap fonts that were hand-drawn with Toshi Omagari's fantastic book [Arcade Game Typography](https://readonlymemory.vg/shop/book/arcade-game-typography/) as reference. And while these fonts have been made with [Playdate](https://play.date/) in mind, they can be used for anything that supports *.fnt files.

Checklist

- all fonts are 8x8 pixels, in most cases with a padding of 1px
- many fonts have a limited character range (`[0-9A-Z]`, sometimes including lowercase character)
- complex fonts with colors have been excluded, some have been added as outlined or filled fonts
- typographic quality was no criteria for inclusion (and there are many bad fonts!)
- PNG previews

I'm currently not interested in contributions of new fonts. However, if come across mistakes you are welcome to post an issue or even a pull request.
