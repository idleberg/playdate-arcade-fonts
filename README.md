# ðŸ‘¾ playdate-arcade-fonts

*This project is work-in-progress*

This project is meant as a love letter to the typography of classic arcade games. It contains a growing collection of bitmap fonts that were hand-drawn with [Toshi Omagari's](https://twitter.com/tosche_e) magnificent book [Arcade Game Typography](https://readonlymemory.vg/shop/book/arcade-game-typography/) as reference. And while these fonts have been made with [Playdate](https://play.date/) in mind, they can be used for anything that supports *.fnt files.

**Checklist**

- all fonts are 8x8 pixels, in most cases with a padding of 1px
- all fonts only cover basic latin characters
- most fonts have a limited character range (`[0-9A-Z]`, rarely including lowercase characters)
- complex fonts with colors have been excluded, some have been added as outlined or filled fonts
- typographic quality was no criteria for inclusion (and there are many bad fonts!)
- PNG previews

I'm currently not interested in contributions of new fonts. However, if you come across mistakes you are welcome to post an [issue](https://github.com/idleberg/playdate-arcade-fonts/issues) or even a [pull request](https://github.com/idleberg/playdate-arcade-fonts/pulls).

**Todo**

- add more fonts
- better filter options on websites
- option to handle missing characters in details view
